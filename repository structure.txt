    * checkstyle
    * logging: uses AspectJ for generating verbose logging when needed

    * db_adapters: contains implementations of the database adapter interface for several data bases, in particular for MySQL and PostgreSQL
    * server_sync_providers_proxies: example implementation of the proxy interface for http based data transmission using JSON for serialization

* apps: contains example applications which use the synchronization framework
   * jmeter: plugin and syncclient for JMeter based performance and load tests
   * server: example implementation of a Java sync server; can be deployed on Tomcat and configured for several database backends
